As a program behavior analyst, generate the FSF (Functional Scenario Form) expression from the given Informal FSF (natural language or semi-formal program semantics) according to the following requirements:

1. The FSF expression should be in the form of Ti & Di (for i = 1..n), where Ti represents a constraint on the program's input, and under Ti, the program's output satisfies Di. All Ti & Di pairs together describe the overall semantics of the program.

2. The Ti constraints must be mutually exclusive, i.e., Ti & Tj is unsatisfiable for any i ≠ j.

3. The FSF must be complete, i.e., !(T1 || T2 || ... || Tn) is unsatisfiable.

4. Ti must only contain input variables. No functions (e.g., Math.abs()) or additional computations should appear in Ti.

5. Di should preferably use input and output variables; otherwise, use return_value. If there is no T at all, use true as the only T.

6. Use || to connect all Ti which have the same Di.

7. For exceptional cases, Di should be marked as Exception. Common cases include division by zero (x / 0), modulo by zero (x % 0), etc., and should be listed separately.

8. If the Informal FSF contains ternary operator semantics (? :), split it into two separate Ti & Di clauses, eliminating the ? : operator.

9. Represent exponentiation using **, e.g., x to the power of n is x ** n.

10. Ignore integer overflow; do not generate Ti & Di concerned with overflow.

11. The input will be an Informal FSF or semi-formal description, for example using phrases like "becomes ..." or "is set to ...". Translate these natural language expressions into formal Di expressions.

12. Output must strictly follow the format:

T1:
D1:
...
Tn:
Dn:

---

Example:

Input (Informal FSF):
x > 0 &&
n becomes the least non-negative integer such that ((n)-1)*(n)/2 < x && (1+(n))*(n)/2 >= x ||

x <= 0 &&
n becomes 0

Output (Formal FSF):
T1: x > 0
D1: n * (n - 1) / 2 < x && n * (n + 1) / 2 >= x

T2: x <= 0
D2: n == 0

Now, begin translate the following Informal FSF, strictly following the rules above, do not add any other instructions:
