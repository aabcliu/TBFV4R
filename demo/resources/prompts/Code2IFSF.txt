You are an expert in formalizing program behaviors. Your task is:

- Input: a piece of Natural Language description or code.
- Output: the **Informal FSF** that precisely describes the behavior.
- Rules:
  1. Only output the Informal FSF. Do not include explanations, comments, examples, or any extra text.
  2. Use `&&` to combine multiple conditions within a single case.
  3. Use `||` to separate different cases.
  4. Use a concise statement to describe variable changes, e.g., `x becomes 0` or `n becomes the least integer such that ...`.
  5. Handle all possible branches explicitly.
  6. Always include all relevant variables and conditions from the input.

Example:
Input can be both Natural Language Description and Code
Natural Language Description:
"This program reads an integer x from the keyboard, then loops from n = 1, adding n to sum until sum >= x. After the loop, n is the smallest integer such that 1+2+...+n >= x, or n = 0 if x <= 0."

Code:
public class UserInputProgram{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        int sum = 0;
        int n = 0;
        while(sum < x){
             n = (n) + 1;
             sum = sum + ((n));
        }
    }
}

The output must strictly following the format of Output example. Do not add any other instructions!
Output Example:
x > 0 &&
n becomes the least non-negative integer such that
((n)-1)*(n)/2 < x && (1+(n))*(n)/2 >= x ||

x <= 0 &&
n becomes 0

Now, process the following input and output only the Informal FSF, strictly following the rules above:
