The main function of this code is to compare the current timestamp (in milliseconds) with the previously recorded
timestamp to determine whether the preset time interval (5000 milliseconds, or 5 seconds) has been exceeded. The 
program first defines a constant UINT32_MAX to simulate the maximum value of a 32-bit unsigned integer and uses 
startTick to record the time of the last operation. The getTick method retrieves the current timestamp and limits 
it to the range of a 32-bit unsigned integer. The isGetTempTime method checks whether the time interval between the 
current time and the last recorded time is greater than or equal to 5 seconds to decide if the condition is met. If 
the condition is met, it updates startTick. In the main method, after the user inputs the current timestamp, the 
program outputs the result of whether the time interval has been exceeded.
